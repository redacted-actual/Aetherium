Aetherium (AETH) is a metamorphic, hardware-aware computational language designed to unify classical, differentiable, and quantum programming models into a single formally verified framework. Unlike traditional languages that separate logic from execution hardware, Aetherium treats the computational context as a first-class type property.
Key Technical Attributes
Metamorphic Type System: Functions and data structures inherit meta-types—Classical, Differentiable, Reversible, or Probabilistic. The compiler enforces mathematical constraints based on these types (e.g., ensuring a Reversible function contains only unitary quantum operations).
Hardware Pinning (@ Operator): Developers explicitly map data and compute blocks to abstract hardware targets such as @host_mem (CPU), @tensor_cores (GPU/TPU), or @qpu_fabric (Quantum Processor).
Native Calculus Integration: Operators like ∇ (gradient) and ⊗ (tensor product) are compiler intrinsics. The compiler automatically generates backward passes for any logic marked Differentiable using high-performance algorithmic differentiation.
Unified Memory & Graph Semantics: Aetherium natively supports Tensor structures and HyperGraph lattices, allowing seamless data flow between neural network layers and symbolic memory structures.
Contextual Compute Blocks: The compute {} syntax allows the language to switch its internal assembly generation (e.g., shifting from CUDA kernels to QASM quantum circuits) within the same execution thread.
Structural Organization of the Code
The following implementation follows a Modular Stack architecture. You will observe data moving through a "Stream of Consciousness" loop where high-dimensional latents are processed by polynomial encoders, refined through recursive attention, and occasionally projected into a quantum Hilbert space for exploratory ideation.
